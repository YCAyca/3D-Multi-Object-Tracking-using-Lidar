# Dataset Types

There are different datasets open for Autonomus Driving researchs. 3 of them is examined in this report.

## Kitti

The first and naturally oldest dataset. 

<b> The setup contains: </b>

- 2 RGB camera facing forward (10 Hz)
- 2 Grayscale camera facing forward (10 Hz)
- 1 Velodyne Lidar Sensor (10 Hz, 64 laser beams, 100 m range)

<img src="detection_report/kitti_setup.png" width=50% height=70%>

<b> The Lidar Coordinate System and the Ranges </b>

- x-axes : front, y-axes : left, z axes : up

- The point cloud range used for model training [0, -40, -3, 70.4, 40, 1] (xmin ymin zmin xmax ymax zmax) which gives 70.4 meters for front view, 80 meters for side view being left and right and 4 meters for the height range

- The intensity range [0,1]

- Lidar located at 1.73 m 


<b>  Format </b>

- Lidar data contains x, y, z, intensity informations and its in .bin format

  <img src="detection_report/kitti_lidar.png" width=30% height=50%>

- Object Detection annotation files contains the following information and its in .txt format 
          

   <img src="detection_report/kitti_od_format.png" width=40% height=50%>
   <img src="detection_report/kitti_od_anno.png" width=75% height=100%>

* The dataset contains 8 classes for object detection: Car, Van, Truck, Pedestrian, Person(sitting), Cyclist, Tram, Misc 

- In addition to the Object Detection dataset and annotations, there is another dataset for Object Tracking having the data arranged in sequences rather than different scenes from different moments like in Object Detection dataset. For this dataset the annotation format has 2 additional info 

   <img src="detection_report/kitti_tr_format.png" width=40% height=50%>
   <img src="detection_report/kitti_tr_anno.png" width=75% height=100%>



* As seen in annotation format too, <b> the ground truth annotations of the KITTI dataset has been provided in the 2D image space (in left grayscale camera frame called reference camera frame) not in 3D lidar space. </b> Therefore, to work with Lidar data, these 2D annotations should be converted to the 3D space using calibration files which gives the rotation and translation matrices between the lidar and camera sensors for each spesific frame.  <b>  Having annotations in image space is the base reason to cut the poing cloud x axis range to [0,70]. So we use only the front view but not the back view since the cameras only setup face forward (since the annotations located only in front side) . </b> 

   <img src="detection_report/kitti_calib.png" width=80% height=100%>

   <b> P2 </b> : the left RGB camera's projection matrix from the reference camera frame

   <b> R0_rect </b>: Rectification matrix (correct the planar alignment between camera and reference camera frame) 

   <b>  Tr_velo_to_cam </b>: Point clouds frame to reference camera frame rigid body transformation (translation + rotation) matrix

   To understand better the usage of these calibration information, the data transformation between annotation boxes to lidar data is explained below.

<b> Data Transformation in Kitti </b>

* There are 3 steps between lidar and image plane:

   <img src="detection_report/kitti_transformation.png" width=40% height=50%>

   In general, to project bounding boxes in lidar space, we first go from lidar to image plane to eliminate the point clouds staying outside of the image borders. Then project the bounding boxes on this newly created lidar space.

   From Lidar to Image Plane
   ```

   proj_mat = P2 @ R0_rect @ Tr_velo_to_cam

   ```

   Boxes in lidar plane 

   ```

   R_inv = np.linalg.inv(R0_rect)
   Tr_inv = np.linalg.inv(Tr_velo_to_cam)

   proj_mat = R_inv @ Tr_inv 

   ```

   Bounding boxes in cropped lidar space:

   <img src="detection_report/lidar_cropped.png" width=50% height=50%>

   Bounding boxes in not cropped lidar space:

   <img src="detection_report/lidar_notcropped1.png" width=40% height=50%> 
   <img src="detection_report/lidar_notcropped2.png" width=40% height=50%>


   To visualize bounding boxes in images, a simple projection should be applied too since the bounding boxes are in reference camera frame and the RGB images are provided in the dataset. (which is better than grayscale reference camera to visualize...) 

   3D Bounding Boxes In Cam2 Image Plane

   ```
   proj_mat = P2

   ```

   <img src="detection_report/image_w_boxes.png" width=40% height=50%>

   Most of the frameworks to train a model with kitti already applies these transformations as preprocess, but to visualize or process the data manually this [repo](https://github.com/darylclimb/cvml_project/tree/cb06850b9477550b9c9e3c5651d013b347cc9b1b/projections/lidar_camera_projection)  can be used. 

<b> Visualization </b>

1. 
   Another nice [repo](https://github.com/kuixu/kitti_object_vis) to visualize kitti with ground truth boxes and labels in 3D lidar space. I use this one to visualize ground truths at the same time with the model output to compare.
   Using  repo, the kitti point cloud data with ground truth boxes can be visualized in 3D space.

   1. conda create -n kitti_vis python=3.7
   2. conda activate kitti_vis
   3. pip install opencv-python pillow scipy matplotlib
   4. conda install mayavi -c conda-forge
   5. pip install poetry
   6. pip install importlib-resources
   7. put your data in data/object/ folder as explained in readme <br>
      <img src="detection_report/kitti_viz.png" width=20% height=70%>
   8. python kitti_object.py --show_lidar_with_depth --img_fov --const_box --vis

      <img src="detection_report/kitti_visual.png" width=50% height=100%>

   !! conda update ffmpeg to solve ImportError: libopenh264.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory problem if occurs


2. As mentioned above, kitti's detection and tracking dataset is different as well as their annotation format. SO the above interface is only for detection visualization. Instead of adapting this code to wotk with tracking too, I found another [visualizer](https://github.com/hailanyi/3D-Detection-Tracking-Viewer) which works separetaly for detection and tracking datasets 

   1. I used the same anaconda environment (kitti-vis) just added vedo with pip install vedo 
   2. put your data in data/ folder as explained in readme <br>
   3. python kitti_3D_tracking_viewer.py 
   4. As default, the tracking visualizer uses 0001. sequence, to change simply update the label_path = r"data/tracking/label_02/0001.txt" to the label of chosen sequence and seq_id in dataset = KittiTrackingDataset(root,seq_id=1,label_path=label_path)

# Paper Reviews

## Pointnet (2016)

paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00593.pdf  

a good video explains the paper : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_py5pcMfHoc

official code : https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet

* First paper proposes to process 3D points directly, without projecting to 2D images etc
* Challenges for processing point clouds <br>
   1. The lidar data is unstructured so the model should be permutation invariant (if you have n points you have n! permutations of ordering and processing this data)

       <img src="detection_report/unstructured.png" width=30% height=30%>

   2. Interaction of points (the relation between neighbor points (local features) and general relation (global features) should be extracted. For classification, the global features are important since the task is to decide for a global class for the whole point cloud. For segmentation,  a combination of local and global knowledge is required

   3. The model should be transform(translation - rotation) invariant  (A chair is still a chair when its rotated 90 degree etc)

   ### Model Architecture


    <img src="detection_report/pointnet.png" width=100% height=30%>

   * <b> Input and Feature Transform </b>

      Both using T-Net (which is an independent neural network consists of 3 convolutional, 1 max pooling and 2 fully connected layers inorde) trained to estimate different transform matrices to be applied by matrix multiplication. Input transform is applied to the first input and the feature transform to the first feature map comes after input layer.

      This is the <b> solution for transform invariant </b> challenge that this paper proposes!

   * <b> MLP (Multi layer perception) </b>

      Nothing more than a fully connected layer. The trick here is to use this fully connected layer 1 by 1 to the points come from transform layer then to concatanate.

   * <b> Max Pooling </b>

      The second MLP layer gives nx1024 output and a maximul pooling layer is applied on it. In this way, the global features are obtained without depending on the points order. <b> This is the solution for unstructured data challenge </b> that the paper proposes! 

   * These global features directly goes to classify the point cloud

   * Local and global features are concatenated for segmentation part as an extention of the    architecture.

      <img src="detection_report/pointnet-paint.png" width=100% height=30%>

   
   PointNet architecture doesnt allow to do Object Detection alone but after this paper, various methods to realize object detection on point cloud data is started to come up.

## Voxelnet (2017)

paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.06396.pdf 

a good video explains the paper : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox1qNGgEqPU&t=169s 

Nice implementation : https://github.com/gkadusumilli/Voxelnet 

* First paper realize end to end 3d object detection processing Point Cloud Data.
* First paper uses Pointnet logic inside.
* Pointnet is for processing pretty small point cloud data having about <b> 1000 points </b> referring to a simple object like chair table etc. If the subject is Autonomus Driving, around <b> 100k points </b> are found in an environment with different objects to detect like Cars, Pedestrians, Cyclists, Van, Truck, Trees, Buildings etc. This fact make Pointnet method requires too much computational cost and slow speed. In this sense, <b> Voxelnet comes with the idea of dividing the whole Point Cloud in voxels and process them one by one </b>.

<b> Model Architecture </b>

<img src="detection_report/voxelnet_arc.png" width=50% height=30%>

It contains 3 main steps:

1. 3D data to Voxel partition -> Feature learning network (Process these points in voxels similarly to how Pointnet does)
2. Convolutional middle layers (3D CNN to extract the features)
3. Region proposal network (last layer to obtain detection results)


* <b> Voxel Partition </b>

1. Voxel depth, height, width referring to the z y x axes are determined. 
A grid size having D = point cloud z range / voxel depth, H = point cloud y range / voxel height,  W = point cloud w range / voxel width is calculated. Being T is the maximum number of points in a voxel, all the points are selected randomly one by one and placed in the most near voxel. If a voxel is already full, the selected point is ignored. ( <b> Random Sampling </b>)

* <b> Feature Learning Network </b>

The Feature Learning consists of 2 VFE (Voxelnet Feature Encoding) layers which are identical structures (except of their size being <b> VFE-1(7, 32) and VFE-2(32, 128) </b> ) applied in a row. 

In this sense:

2. One point in a voxel has the following structure : <br>
Vin = {Ëpi =[xi, yi, zi, ri, xi â vx, yi â vy , zi â vz ]T â R7}i=1...t. 
Which explains that every input point in a voxel has <b> 7 features being x,y,z coordinates, reflectance (or intensity), the mean of the x coordinates in a voxel - x, the mean of the y coordinates in a voxel - y, the mean of the z coordinates in a voxel - z </b>

3. Instead of having n x 3 points like in PointNet, 7 x n points are given as input to the shared Fully Connected Layer and 16 x n matrix is obtained as output. 

4. Keeping a copy of this output aside as local features, max pooling is applied to obtain global features in 32 x 1 size. These global features are concatenated with local features and the 32 x n output feature map is passed to the next VFE layer.

   <img src="detection_report/vfe.png" width=30% height=30%>

5. The same logic is applied this time for a shared Fully Connected Layer and obtained 64 x n matrix is obtained as output. Keeping a copy of this output aside as local features, max pooling is applied to obtain global features in 64 x 1 size. These global features are concatenated with local features and a last maximum pooling is applied to the 64 x n output feature map to obtain the final output of the Feature Learning Network for one Voxel

6. This output is 128x1 vector and all the outputs come from voxels are concatenated through the same locations they come from. Which gives us 128xDxWxH size 4D tensor. (128 x Grid Size output tensor)

    <img src="detection_report/fle.png" width=80% height=30%>

In the paper, following sizes are used for Kitti Dataset:

Point Cloud Range -> z: [â3, 1] y: [â40, 40] x: [0, 70.4] 
Voxel Size -> vD = 0.4, vH = 0.2, vW = 0.2 meters. 
Grid Size -> D = 4 / 0.4 = 10 , W = 80 / 0.2 = 400 , H = 70.4 / 0.2 = 352 

Which gives  10x400x352 = 1408000 voxels to send the Feature Learning Layer 1 by 1 and a 128 Ã 10 Ã 400 Ã 352 4D tensor is obtained.


This 4D tensor is then passed to the 3D CNN.


* <b> Convolutional Middle Layers </b>

   This step consists of 3 convolutional layers to extract features in 3D. 

   Conv3D(128, 64, 3,(2,1,1), (1,1,1)) <br>
   Conv3D(64, 64, 3, (1,1,1), (0,1,1)) <br>
   and Conv3D(64, 64, 3, (2,1,1), (1,1,1)) in order.
   
   with respect to the following syntax 
   Conv3D(cin, cout, k, s, p) 

   cin : input channel size <br>
   cout : output channel size <br>
   k : kernel size <br>
   s : stride <br>
   p : padding  <br>

   ! k, s, p can be either an integer or tuple. If integer, that means all 3 dimensions is in equal size. For example in Voxelnet architecture the kernel size is 3 for both depth, width and height.

   The output of a 3D convolutional layer is calculated according to the following equation :

   <img src="detection_report/3d_calc.png" width=50% height=30%>

   Accordingly, we can visualize Voxelnet 3D Feature Extraction process as follows:

   <img src="detection_report/3d-cnn.png" width=80% height=30%>

   This (64 Ã 2 Ã 400 Ã 352) output 4D tensor then reshaped to (128 x 400 x 352) to be able to apply 2D convolutions and obtain detection results.

* <b> Region proposal network </b>

   An RPN in general refers to a neural network used to predict different region proposals (ROI boxes) with objectness score without any classifying. 

   <b> Explanation of original RPN (Faster RCNN RPN logic)  </b>

   Every point in feature map is an anchor center point and k different anchor boxes are produced for each center point using pre-determined anchor box size and scales. 

   <img src="detection_report/rpn1.png" width=80% height=30%>

   2 parallel CNN is applied to the same anchor box map :

   1.REGRESSION LAYER: For each anchor box, one region proposal is created. These regions are determined by the offsets to the related anchor box.

   <img src="detection_report/rpn2.png" width=60% height=30%>

   2.CLASSIFICATION LAYER: For each region proposal, an objectness score is calculated to decide whether this region box has an object or not (whether its a foreground region or background) without taking into account any class spesific analysis. 

   Considering that original RPN has 9 anchors, we obtain 9x2(1 for foreground possibility 1 for background possibility) channel output for classification layer and 9x4(dx, dy, dw, dh) channel output for regression layer

   <img src="detection_report/rpn3.png" width=45% height=30%>

   Then the selected boxes (the boxes having higher score for foreground class than background class) are passed to the classification layer (mostly a fully connected layer to decide whether this box contains a dog or cat bird etc) 

   FInally, NMS suppression is applied to eliminate overlapping boxes and only keep the box having the highest probability for the spesific class.

    <img src="detection_report/nms1.png" width=50% height=30%>

   <b> Explanation of Voxelnet's RPN logic </b> 

   <img src="detection_report/rpn.png" width=80% height=30%>

   * A chain of convolution - deconvolution are applied to improve the feature map. 
   * 2 anchor boxes used. 
   * Then the same 2 parallel CNN logic for regression and classification are applied. 
   * The output of regression map is 14 channel since 1 3D box is explained with 7 coordinates and we have 2 anchors.
   * The output of probability score map (mentioned as classification map above) is 2 channel since we have 2 anchors and in voxelnet's rpn only 1 class is used for objectness score. Instead of having different probabilities for foreground and background objects and pick the one having higher probability, they only have one class for objectness score and the proposed box is picked if the objectness score is higher than a threshold.
   * No need to apply any further classification model since the RPN is applied one by one for each class. So if the objectness score is high, the box directly is sent to NMS. 

   !!! The reason that in Point Cloud RPN models, we apply that part separately for different classes is that each class has its own spesific size and scale rather than having a common size and scale as in image based models.
 

<b>  Accuracy performance on 3D boxes  </b>

 <img src="detection_report/voxelnet_acc.png" width=80% height=30%>

<b> Disadvantages </b>

* It is said to be slow for real time detection and the bottleneck is the 3D CNN for the speed which requires too much computational cost. 

* The model is created to work with 1 class at a time. It is something which may improved but most of the frameworks or implementations  still provide single class models.


## Second : Sparsely Embedded Convolutional Detection (2018)

paper : https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5125/a16039cabc6320c908a4764f32596e018ad3.pdf 

official code : https://github.com/traveller59/second.pytorch 

<b>  Model Architecture </b>

The model architecture is very similar to the Voxelnet with only some little changes which brings improvements to the model speed.

 <img src="detection_report/second_arc.png" width=50% height=30%>

 The main change is to use <b> 3D Sparse Convolutional Neural Networks instead of Voxelnet's 3D CNN </b>.

 The logic behing Sparse CNN is to use only non-zero data in feature maps and apply convolution only on these parts which is very useful for Lidar data having a very sparse structure.

* <b> Quick Look to Sparse CNNs </b>

   1. Graham, B. Spatially-sparse convolutional neural networks. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.6070.pdf  

      Founder of the Sparse CNNs.  <br>
      This one is only for 2D CNNs. 
      
      "Sparse CNNs can be thought of as an extension of the idea of sparse matrices. If a large matrix only has small number of non-zero entries per row and per column,then it makes sense to use a special data structure to store the non-zero entries and their locations; this can both dramatically reduce memory requirements and speed up operations such as matrix multiplication."

      To forward propagate the network it is calculated two matrices for each
      layer of the network: <br>
      â¦ A feature matrix which is a list of row vectors, one for the ground state, and one for each active spatial location in the layer; the width of the matrix is the number of features per spatial location. <br>
      â¦ A pointer matrix with size equal to the spatial size of the convolutional layer. <br>
      For each spatial location in the convolutional layer, we store the number of the corresponding row in the feature matrix.

      <img src="detection_report/sparse_cnn.png" width=50% height=30%>

      It is seen that the convolution is applied only to the areas having active points (non-zero data) and as the output all this area become active points. All the other parts staying outside the active area just passed to the output without any process.

   2. Graham, B. Sparse 3D convolutional neural networks. https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02890 

      Same logic is implemented for 3D CNNs.

   3. Graham, B.; van der Maate Submanifold Sparse Convolutional Networks. https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01307 

      In this version, the output feature map is in the same size with input feature map and an output point becomes active only if it was active in input data map too. This is called <b> VSC (valid sparse convolution) </b> too.  

      <img src="detection_report/submanifold.png" width=30% height=30%>

      The reason of this change is, for deep neural networks, the sparsity disappears too much that the performance inhancement of SC disappears too. So protecting the sparsity as it was in the input feature map may help for especially creating sparse deep neural networks.

      Finally, the paper presents 5 mini network blocks using VSC to create sparse deep neural neutworks by combining these blocks. 
      
      <img src="detection_report/vsc-combinations.png" width=30% height=30%>
      
      The deep neural networks created using these mini blocks are called Submanifold Sparse Neural Networks.


There are 2 different implementation of the paper presents as Second (using Submanifold Sparse CNN), and Second Small (using Sparse CNN).

Its seen that beside of the speed performance, accuracy is pretty better than Voxelnet too.    

<b> Disadvantages </b>

Even the performance and speed is far way better then Voxelnet, it still uses 3D CNN which stays as a bottleneck.

## Pointpillar (2018)

 paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05784

 official code : https://github.com/nutonomy/second.pytorch  (implemented on second's official code)

* A method for object detection in 3D that enables end-to-end learning with
<b> only 2D convolutional layers </b>.

* Instead of dividing the Point Cloud to 3D Voxels, it divides them to the Pillars (columns). In other words, <b> the grid created on the Point Cloud is not 3D but 2D having only width and height but not depth since the space doesnt get divided in z direction. </b> 

  Voxel Partition :

  <img src="detection_report/voxel.png" width=20% height=30%>

  Pillar Partition :
  
  <img src="detection_report/pillar.png" width=20% height=30%>

* One point in one pillar has the following structure with 9 features:
Pin = {Ëpi =[xi, yi, zi, ri, xc, yc, zc, xp, yp ]T â R7}i=1...t
x, y, z and reflectance r, c subscript denotes distance to the arithmetic mean of all points in the pillar and the p subscript denotes the offset from the pillar x, y center. Therefore 

* With this structure of not having D in grid, it is obtained CxWxH output 3D tensor and it is therefore possible to apply directly 2D CNN instead of 3D to extract high resolution features.

<b> Model Architecture </b>


<img src="detection_report/pointpillar_arc.png" width=80% height=30%>


THe model contains similarly to the Voxelnet and Second 3 main steps:

1. 3D data to Pillar partition -> Pillar Feature Network 
2. Convolutional middle layers (2D CNN to extract the features)
3. SSD (last layer to obtain detection results)

It is seen that another change the paper does is to use SSD differently from Voxelnet and Second.

<b> SSD Architecture </b>

* While RPN was a two stage detector, SSD is a one stage detector. The feature map is used to generate the region proposals using anchors with the same logic as RPN and classification is applied directly on these regions for c classes without having any additional objectness score calculation step.

<b> Accuracy performance on 3D boxes </b>

Its seen that its x3 faster then Second and the accuracy is better in general except of Car - easy.


## PV-RCNN : PointVoxel-RCN (2019)

It seems to be best model (at least for kitti dataset) until now in the sense of accuracy. There is no information about speed performance though.

# OpenPCDET Usage and Experiments

## Building the Environment

To prevent the version conflicts between Cuda - Pytorch Version - Spvconv librqry - Openpcdet requirements, please follow the declared versions that I found working compatible:

* conda create -n openpcdet python=3.8 anaconda

* conda source activate openpcdet

* pip install torch==1.8.1+cu101 torchvision==0.9.1+cu101 torchaudio==0.8.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

* pip install spconv-cu102

* git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet.git 

* python setup.py develop (cd Desktop/OpenPCDet)

* pip install open3d 

* export PYTHONPATH="/home/yagmur/Desktop/OpenPCDet"


## Train 

## with Kitti

<b> 1. Prepare the dataset </b>

   The dataset should be prepared as kitti_infos_train.pkl, kitti_infos_test.pkl, kitti_infos_val.pkl, and a gt_database folder which keeps all the ground truth boxes in different point clouds.

   To do that, place the dataset as following in OpenPCDet/data/kitti folder:

   <img src="detection_report/kitti_dataset_arrange.png" width=20% height=50%>
   <img src="detection_report/kitti_dataset_arrange2.png" width=20% height=50%>
   <img src="detection_report/kitti_dataset_arrange3.png" width=20% height=50%>


   Then run the following code:
   ```
   python -m pcdet.datasets.kitti.kitti_dataset create_kitti_infos tools/cfgs/dataset_configs/kitti_dataset.yaml  (cd OpenPCDET)
   ```

   Which gives you the following files as output:

   <img src="detection_report/dataset_output.png" width=20% height=50%>


<b> 2. Select a model and train </b>

   There are different models' configuration files. 
   
   <img src="detection_report/cfgs.png" width=20% height=50%>
   
   Select the model you want to train and run the following command:

   ```
   python train.py --cfg_file cfgs/kitti_models/second.yaml 
   ```

   The model configuration file contains dataset configuration file which directs the created train.pkl, val.pkl files to be used during the training. So giving the model configuration file is enogh.

<b> 3. Visualize the results (train loss, learning rate evaluation) </b>

   ```
   tensorboard --logdir=/home/yagmur/Desktop/OpenPCDet/output/kitti_models/second/default_05032022/tensorboard/ --host=127.0.0.1
   ```
   
   <img src="detection_report/train_chart.png" width=40% height=50%>

   The process of train loss, learning rate evaluation and only the evaluation of the last checkpoint (final model) on validation dataset can be found in log.txt file too.

   <img src="detection_report/log1.png" width=40% height=50%>
   <img src="detection_report/log2.png" width=40% height=50%>


<b> 4. Train with validation dataset evaluation </b>

   To obtain validation dataset accuracy evaluated at the end of each epoch of training, use --val_acc True flag for example:

   ```
   python train.py --cfg_file cfgs/kitti_models/second.yaml --val_acc True
   ```

   At the end, tensorboard graphs are avaliable for evaluation.

   ```
   tensorboard --logdir=/home/yagmur/Desktop/OpenPCDet/output/kitti_models/second/default_10032022/ckpt/validation_accuracy/tensorboard --host=127.0.0.1
   ```

   <img src="detection_report/eval_graph.png" width=40% height=50%>

   With this usage, all the evaluation information is written in log.txt file too in contrary of only the last one as in the previous option.

<b> Possible Errors and Their Solutions </b> 

* CUDA initialization: CUDA unknown error - this may be due to an incorrectly set up environment, e.g. changing env variable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES after program start

   It came after a couple of training I made without turning off the computer. I turned off and open the PC it worked.

* Caught KeyError in DataLoader worker process 0 KeyError: 'road_plane'

   Change "USE_ROAD_PLANE: True" to "USE_ROAD_PLANE: False" in model.yaml file

* CUDA out of memory 

  Even if the training is finished, CUDA cache is not emptied. Therefore deactivate and activate anaconda environment after the end of the training everytime. 

  If above doesnt solve, it means that even CUDA cache is empty, it doesnt have enough place to load the dataset with given batch size. Therefore the batch size should be decreased in model.yaml file

* Dataloader killed signal

   Decrease the batch size.

## with Pandaset 

* git clone git@github.com:scaleapi/pandaset-devkit.git
* cd pandaset-devkit/python
* pip install .

<b> !! </b> Change requirements.txt in pandadevkit as following to solve the conflict with openpcdet environments. Otherwise Openpcdet collapse and it becomes unavailable to even train with kitti etc.

gmplot>=1.2.0 <br>
numpy>=1.18.2 <br>
pandas>=1.0.3 <br>
Pillow>=7.0.0 <br>
transforms3d>=0.3.1 <br>

* Place the dataset as follows

  <img src="detection_report/panda_dataset.png" width=30% height=50%>


* python -m pcdet.datasets.pandaset.pandaset_dataset create_pandaset_infos tools/cfgs/dataset_configs/pandaset_dataset.yaml

<b> !! </b> Change pandaset_dataset.py if you dont use the whole dataset but some scenes 

   <img src="detection_report/pandasetpy.png" width=25% height=50%>

* python train.py --cfg_file cfgs/pandaset_models/pv_rcnn.yaml 

<b> !! </b>  --val_acc True is not supported yet.


## Evaluation 

## with Kitti

   If the model trained without --val_acc True option but you want to obtain all the evaluation progress, use the following command:

   ```
   python test.py --cfg_file  cfgs/kitti_models/second.yaml --batch_size 1 --ckpt /home/yagmur/Desktop/OpenPCDet/output/kitti_models/second/default_05032022/ckpt --eval_all
   ```
   Or evaluate a spesific checkpoint :

   ```
   python test.py --cfg_file  cfgs/kitti_models/second.yaml --batch_size 1 --ckpt /home/yagmur/Desktop/OpenPCDet/output/kitti_models/second/default_05032022/ckpt/checkpoint_epoch_60.pth 
   ```

## Test - Inference 

## with Kitti

```
python demo.py --cfg_file cfgs/kitti_models/second.yaml --ckpt /home/yagmur/Desktop/OpenPCDet/output/kitti_models/second/default_15032022/ckpt/checkpoint_epoch_80.pth --data_path /home/yagmur/Desktop/OpenPCDet/data/kitti/testing_small/velodyne 
```

<img src="detection_report/inference3.png" width=40% height=50%>

The kitti visualizer explained in Datasets -> Kitti section may be used here to compare model predictions with ground truth (good to fine tune inference parameters like score threshold)

<img src="detection_report/inference_with_gt.png" width=60% height=50%>


## with Pandaset on a Pandaset Trained Model

```
python inference_pandaset.py --cfg_file cfgs/pandaset_models/pv_rcnn.yaml --ckpt /home/yagmur/Desktop/OpenPCDet/output/pandaset_models/pv_rcnn/default/ckpt/checkpoint_epoch_80.pth --data_path /home/yagmur/Desktop/OpenPCDet/data/pandaset/
```

Its enough to give the general path of pandaset dataset, the data is already splitted as train, validation, test and inference_pandaset.py directly programmed to use test dataset.

<img src="detection_report/panda_inference.png" width=60% height=50%>

!! to see ground truth boxes at the same time use --show_gt

## Test Between Different Datasets

Due to the different configurations of different datasets, the prediction performance may not be well between different datasets (when you train a model with one dataset and test with another). The following points are important to make the test dataset compatible with train dataset configurations

* Beam size 

   A lidar with a beam 64 produces more points then 16 or 32. Therefore, in a dataset created by 64 beam lidar we obtain more points in a ROI. (A car contains 50 points in a 64 beam lidar point cloud while it contains lets say 10 in a 16 beam lidar point cloud data)

* Coordinate System

   Openpcdet uses "uniform coordinate system" which is equivalent to Kitti's coordinate system. To train a custom dataset, the coordinate system (x y z axes of the lidar) should be arranged in the same way of this coordinate system. Its already done at the background of openpcdet for training with nuscene, pandaset etc but to test it should be done manually. (So even if you trained a model with pandaset and you want to test with pandaset, you need to make this transformation because the training is done according to this uniform coordinate system)

* Intensity Range

   Intensity range is used in training process by default. The uniform model that Openpcdet uses is again equivalent to Kitti dataset [0,1]. So the same process should be applied as coordinate system

* Lidar Setup Height

   The Z position of the lidar may effect the result. Hence its better to decrease or increase the Z position of points in the point cloud according to the train dataset's lidar height.

## OpenPCDet Model Configuration File

   *  PREPARE: 
   {
      filter_by_min_points: ['Car:5', 'Pedestrian:5', 'Cyclist:5'], 
   }

      Only include gt boxes which have at least the specified number of points. This is the configuration for kitti created by 64 beams-lidar, in nuscene case which is created by 32 beams-lidar, these numbers are 1. 

   * SAMPLE_GROUPS: ['Car:15','Pedestrian:15', 'Cyclist:15'] 

      The value here indicates that the sampler will sample at least that many instances of the classes in one batch.   

   * NUM_POINT_FEATURES: 4

      The number of the features that 1 point has. For Kitti its 4 (x,y,z,i); for Nuscene its 5 (x,y,z,i,timestamp); for Pandaset its 6 (x,y,z,i,timestamp, lidar id). If you dont want to use other than x,y,z,i information (or even not i for training) you can change this number and update the following configuration:

      POINT_FEATURE_ENCODING: { <br>
         encoding_type: absolute_coordinates_encoding, <br>
         used_feature_list: ['x', 'y', 'z', 'intensity', 'timestamp'], <br>
         src_feature_list: ['x', 'y', 'z', 'intensity', 'timestamp'], <br>
      }

   * VOXEL_SIZE: [ 0.05, 0.05, 0.1] #Voxel sizes in x y z direction
      MAX_POINTS_PER_VOXEL: 5
      MAX_NUMBER_OF_VOXELS: {
        'train': 16000,
        'test': 40000
      }

      POINT_CLOUD_RANGE:  [0, -40, -3, 70.4, 40, 1] #Point Cloud Range in meters xmin ymin zmin xmax ymax zmax which gives 70.4 meter for front view, 80 meter for left right sides and 4 meter for height in Kitti case

      Voxel sizes in meter which determines the Grid Size by division to the Point Cloud Range.
      For Second the Grid Size must be a multiple of (16,16,40)   
      For Pointpillar the Grid Size must be a multiple of (16,16) and 1 for Z direction.

## Fine Tuning with Kitti 

<img src="detection_report/finetuning.png" width=100% height=100%>

* Beside of train time fine tuning, applying test time fine tuning by mostly arranging score threshold or nms parameters is very effective:

   Before test time fine tuning:

   After test time fine tuning:

  <img src="detection_report/after.png" width=60% height=50%>

* Final Results in Kitti Tracking Dataset

   SECOND, which has the second best model in the context of "accuracy" i chosen rather than PV-RCNN (the best model according to the accuracy) due to the huge inference speed difference.
